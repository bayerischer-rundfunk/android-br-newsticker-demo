# android-br-newsticker-demo
Showcase for a ViewModel-based architecture for retrieving and displaying current BR news content.
- Part of our BR App coding workshop for https://www.medienforum-mittweida.de/medienforum-mittweida-2021/workshops-mfmw2021/

This sample app uses [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html) to fetch current [BR news data](https://br.de/nachrichten) as a news ticker and displays them in a [RecyclerView](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/layout/recyclerview) by using [Data Binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) and [ViewModels](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel). [Dark theme](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/look-and-feel/darktheme) handling is supported. The app is written in [Kotlin](https://developer.android.com/kotlin).
